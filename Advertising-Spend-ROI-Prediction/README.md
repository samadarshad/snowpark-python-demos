# Advertising Spend and ROI Prediction

This is the same demo that was presented during the [Snowflake Summit Opening Keynote](https://events.snowflake.com/summit/agenda/session/849836). It is built using Snowpark For Python and Streamlit. For questions and feedback, please reach out to <dash.desai@snowflake.com>.

## Overview

In this workshop, we will train a Linear Regression model to predict future ROI (Return On Investment) of variable advertising spend budgets across multiple channels including search, video, social media, and email using Snowpark for Python and scikit-learn. By the end of the session, you will have an interactive web application deployed visualizing the ROI of different allocated advertising spend budgets.

Workshop highlights:

* Set up your favorite IDE (e.g. Jupyter, VSCode) for Snowpark and ML
* Analyze data and perform data engineering tasks using Snowpark DataFrames
* Use open-source Python libraries from a curated Anaconda channel with near-zero maintenance or overhead
* Deploy ML model training code to Snowflake using Python Stored Procedures
* Create and register Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for inference
* Create Streamlit web application that uses the UDF for real-time prediction

If all goes well, you should see the following app in your browser window.

## Prerequisites

* [Snowflake account](https://signup.snowflake.com/)
  * Login to your [Snowflake account](https://app.snowflake.com/) with the admin credentials that were created with the account in one browser tab (a role with ORGADMIN privileges). Keep this tab open during the workshop.
    * Click on the **Billing** on the left side panel
    * Click on [Terms and Billing](https://app.snowflake.com/terms-and-billing)
    * Read and accept terms to continue with the workshop
  * As ACCOUNTADMIN role
    * Create a [Warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-warehouse.html), a [Database](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-database.html) and a [Schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema.html)

## Setup
Open a Worksheet from the left-hand panel, and connect the worksheet to your newly created database and schema from the prerequisites above.

  ```sql
  USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
  ```

### **Step 1** -- Create Tables, Load Data and Setup Stages

* Create table CAMPAIGN_SPEND from data hosted on publicly accessible S3 bucket

  ```sql
  CREATE or REPLACE file format csvformat
    skip_header = 1
    type = 'CSV';

  CREATE or REPLACE stage campaign_data_stage
    file_format = csvformat
    url = 's3://sfquickstarts/Summit 2022 Keynote Demo/campaign_spend/';

  CREATE or REPLACE TABLE CAMPAIGN_SPEND (
    CAMPAIGN VARCHAR(60), 
    CHANNEL VARCHAR(60),
    DATE DATE,
    TOTAL_CLICKS NUMBER(38,0),
    TOTAL_COST NUMBER(38,0),
    ADS_SERVED NUMBER(38,0)
  );

  COPY into CAMPAIGN_SPEND
    from @campaign_data_stage;
  ```

* Create table MONTHLY_REVENUE from data hosted on publicly accessible S3 bucket

  ```sql
  CREATE or REPLACE stage monthly_revenue_data_stage
    file_format = csvformat
    url = 's3://sfquickstarts/Summit 2022 Keynote Demo/monthly_revenue/';

  CREATE or REPLACE TABLE MONTHLY_REVENUE (
    YEAR NUMBER(38,0),
    MONTH NUMBER(38,0),
    REVENUE FLOAT
  );

  COPY into MONTHLY_REVENUE
    from @monthly_revenue_data_stage;
  ```

* Create table BUDGET_ALLOCATIONS_AND_ROI that holds the last six months of budget allocations and ROI

  ```sql
  CREATE or REPLACE TABLE BUDGET_ALLOCATIONS_AND_ROI (
    MONTH varchar(30),
    SEARCHENGINE integer,
    SOCIALMEDIA integer,
    VIDEO integer,
    EMAIL integer,
    ROI float
  );

  INSERT INTO BUDGET_ALLOCATIONS_AND_ROI (MONTH, SEARCHENGINE, SOCIALMEDIA, VIDEO, EMAIL, ROI)
  VALUES
  ('January',35,50,35,85,8.22),
  ('February',75,50,35,85,13.90),
  ('March',15,50,35,15,7.34),
  ('April',25,80,40,90,13.23),
  ('May',95,95,10,95,6.246),
  ('June',35,50,35,85,8.22);
  ```

* Create stages required for Stored Procedures, UDFs, and saving model files

  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE dash_sprocs;
  CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE dash_models;
  CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE dash_udfs;
  ```

## Notebook and Streamlit App

### **Step 1** -- CLone Repo

* `git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowpark-python-demos` OR `git clone git@github.com:Snowflake-Labs/snowpark-python-demos.git`

* `cd Advertising-Spend-ROI-Prediction`

### **Step 2** -- Create And Activate Conda Environment

(OR, you may use any other Python environment with Python 3.8) 

* `pip install conda`
  
* `conda create --name snowpark -c https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake python=3.8`

* `conda activate snowpark`

### **Step 3** -- Install Snowpark for Python and other libraries in Conda environment

* `pip install "snowflake-snowpark-python[pandas]"`

* `pip install notebook`

* `pip install ipykernel`

* `pip install scikit-learn`

### **Step 4** -- Update [connection.json](connection.json) with your Snowflake account details and credentials

### **Step 5** -- Run through the [Jupyter notebook](Snowpark_For_Python.ipynb)

In a terminal window, browse to the folder where you have this Notebook downloaded and run `jupyter notebook`

The notebook does the following...

* Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Creates features for training a model and writes them to a Snowflake table
* Creates a Stored Proc for training a ML model and uploads the model to a stage
* Calls the Stored Proc to train the model
* Creates a User-Defined Function (UDF) that uses the model for inference on new data points passed in as parameters
  * NOTE: This UDF is called from the Streamlit app

### **Step 6** -- Run Streamlit app

In a terminal window, browse to this folder where you have this file downloaded and run the [Streamlit app](Snowpark_Streamlit_Revenue_Prediction.py) by executing `streamlit run Snowpark_Streamlit_Revenue_Prediction.py`

If all goes well, you should see the following app in your browser window.
